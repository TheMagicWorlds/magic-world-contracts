When writing Code

- Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix.

- Always write the code in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Always write the code in a way that is easy to test.
- Always write the code in a way that is easy to deploy.
- Always write the code in a way that is easy to scale.
- Always write the code in a way that is easy to debug.
